### Why not use Winston?
---
> Was too lazy to read the docs and thought this would be a ez in out job 2 min adventure

## Well can do too much that wasn't asked of it 
```
init()
It accepts a bunch of customization like creating logs or color changing ETC

then just use log.success() or error or trace 
It can write to files as well Might add a DB or cache transport later.|

BUT STILL NOT GONNA USE WINSTTON


JUST HAVING FUN HERE
